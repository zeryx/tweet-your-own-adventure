Just a little tool to enable you to craft choose your own adventure stories on Twitter

This is a work in progress, but to get started ensure that you have a twitter developer account: https://developer.twitter.com

Add your credentials to [credentialsExample.yaml][credentialsExample.yaml] and update [adventure1.yaml][data/adventure1.yaml] to reflect the story you wish to tell.

You can see an example story thread here: https://twitter.com/zeryx1211/status/1310289778189807616

## Next steps:

* Add restart mechanic
* Add more flexibilty to choices
* Add capability for embedded media (images)
* Add ability to delay story branch construction
* Pypi package bundling
